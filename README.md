famous-views-popup
==================

A [Meteor Famo.us Views](https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views) Popup widget.
Tested with Meteor 1.0 but should work with previous versions.

You can see a live demo [here](http://famous-views-popup.meteor.com)

# API

You can read it [here](https://github.com/oorabona/famous-views-popup/demo).

# Support

Tested and developed with Chrome/Chromium. Works somewhat on Firefox, but seems
to have at least opacity problems.

# Changelog

A lot happened recently.
* I reworked the whole demo, added images, new examples and moved API documentation over there.
* Added better sizing (thanks @PEM-- for pointing this out)
* Full support of Bootstrap modals (until an new issue is opened :))
* Code cleanup of course

# TODO

*   Better sizing capabilities
> Sizing can now be done with "[x, y]" like usual or with a shortcut key returning size based on a key string: "modal-lg".

* Fixing *id* issue when used in Popups.show()

* Issues and PR welcome :)
